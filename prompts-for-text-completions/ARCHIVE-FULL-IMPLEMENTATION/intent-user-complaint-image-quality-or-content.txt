Output a JSON array with one object per complaint.  Do not include any additional text outside the JSON response.  If you don't detect any complaints, then just output an empty array.

Complaint Types:

If user indicates that the image is not sharp, lacks detail, is out of focus, or uses any other phrase of similar meaning, then output this JSON object, with complaint_text set to the text you matched:

{"complaint_type": "blurry", "complaint_text: <text you matched">}

If the user indicates that the image is too dark, underexposed, or needs to be brighter, or uses any other phrase of similar meaning, then output this JSON object:

{"complaint_type": "too_dark", "complaint_text: <text you matched">}

If the user indicates that the image is too bright, overexposed, or needs to be darker, or uses any other phrase of similar meaning, then output this JSON object:

{"complaint_type": "too_bright", "complaint_text: <text you matched">}

If the user indicates that there are issues with text in the image, such as misspellings or distorted text, or uses any other phrase of similar meaning, then output this JSON object:
