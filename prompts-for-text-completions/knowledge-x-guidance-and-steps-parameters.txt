Here's a detailed overview of the guidance (CFG) and Steps parameters for the RealVisXL V4.0 Lightning and FLUX.1-dev models, including cutoff values and best combinations for different use cases.

### Low and High Cutoff Values for CFG and Steps
- **CFG Scale Cutoff Values**:
  - For most models, **CFG scales below 2** are typically considered too low, resulting in images that do not follow the prompt accurately and are often overly distorted. The recommended lower range is between **1 and 3** for photorealistic images, particularly for RealVisXL, as values below 1 generally yield images that are unrecognizable or hallucinatory.
  - The **upper cutoff** for CFG scales lies around **10 to 15**. Beyond this, the model tends to overfit to the prompt, leading to unpleasant artifacts and a rigid, unnatural output. For RealVisXL, CFG above 7 can lead to artifacts, making values between **7 and 10** preferable for detail-oriented generations but usually unnecessary for general use cases [6][10].

- **Steps Cutoff Values**:
  - On the low end, **less than 6 steps** can result in incomplete or overly noisy images that lack detail and coherence. For the RealVisXL model, **steps between 6 to 11** offer a balance between time efficiency and quality.
  - On the high end, using **more than 40 steps** often leads to diminishing returns, with limited improvement in image quality and much longer processing times. Steps beyond **16** can cause unnatural sharpness, especially in features like hair [6][10].

### Best Combinations for Different Use Contexts
1. **General Photorealistic Images**:
   - **CFG**: 1-3, **Steps**: 6-11.
   - This combination works well for general use, such as landscapes or everyday scenes, giving a good balance of realism without taking excessive processing time [6].

2. **Highly Detailed Portraits (e.g., Close-ups, Fur, Hair)**:
   - **CFG**: 5-7, **Steps**: 15-25.
   - For detailed subjects like close-ups of faces or animals, increasing the steps helps capture texture, while a slightly higher CFG provides more prompt adherence. Avoid going above **25 steps** unless specifically needed, as it does not significantly improve quality [10].

3. **Artistic or Creative Images**:
   - **CFG**: 2-6, **Steps**: 10-15.
   - Lower CFG values allow for more creative freedom, making them useful for artistic styles or abstract concepts. Steps should be kept in the mid-range to allow for interesting stylistic interpretations while still providing coherence [10].

4. **Realistic Complex Scenes (e.g., Crowded Scenes, Dynamic Activities)**:
   - **CFG**: 4-6, **Steps**: 15-20.
   - In scenes with many elements (like groups of people or bustling cityscapes), a mid-range CFG paired with higher steps helps maintain a balance between detail and adherence to the prompt without overfitting [7][9].

5. **Quick Testing and Iteration**:
   - **CFG**: 4-7, **Steps**: 10-15.
   - When rapidly testing prompts, fewer steps (10-15) provide faster results, and using a mid-range CFG allows you to see if the generated image is heading in the desired direction. This helps in refining prompts efficiently without sacrificing too much quality [10].

### Summary
- **CFG Range**: Keep between **1-10** for most use cases. Lower for creativity (1-3), moderate for realism (4-7), and higher for precision but risk of artifacts (8-10).
- **Steps Range**: Typically **6-25**, where 6-11 is optimal for fast and realistic generations, and higher values are reserved for detailed textures or refining complex prompts.

For RealVisXL V4.0 and FLUX.1-dev, sticking to these ranges ensures efficient and high-quality generation without running into issues of excessive computation or degraded image quality. Let me know if you need more specific guidance for any particular use case!

**Q1: The model isn't adhering closely to my prompts. How can I improve prompt adherence?**

**A:** To enhance prompt adherence:

- **Increase Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) Scale:** Raising the CFG scale (e.g., 12-15) encourages the model to follow your prompt more strictly.
- **Adjust Sampling Steps:** More steps (e.g., 50-100) allow the model to refine details based on your prompt.
- **Refine Your Prompt:** Use clear, specific language. Avoid ambiguity and focus on essential details.
- **Use Prompt Emphasis:** If supported, emphasize key parts of your prompt using brackets or symbols (e.g., `(a red apple)::1.5`).
