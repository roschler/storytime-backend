**Section 1: Parameter Tuning for Common Issues**

---

**Q1: The model isn't adhering closely to my prompts. How can I improve prompt adherence?**

**A:** To enhance prompt adherence:

- **Increase Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) Scale:** Raising the CFG scale (e.g., 12-15) encourages the model to follow your prompt more strictly.
- **Adjust Sampling Steps:** More steps (e.g., 50-100) allow the model to refine details based on your prompt.
- **Refine Your Prompt:** Use clear, specific language. Avoid ambiguity and focus on essential details.
- **Use Prompt Emphasis:** If supported, emphasize key parts of your prompt using brackets or symbols (e.g., `(a red apple)::1.5`).

---

**Q2: How can I get a person or animal to look directly at the camera in the video?**

**A:** To achieve direct eye contact:

- **Include Directives in Your Prompt:** Phrases like "looking into the camera," "direct gaze," or "eye contact" can guide the model.

IMAGE GENERATION TIPS FROM OTHERS:

Author: Authority_Null [FG]

With flux dev i've noticed lower steps makes the images much flatter but higher steps are needed for images where the main focus is text, like a logo

Authority_Null [FG] Titan ‚Äî Today at 12:41 AM

I really like the SG161222/RealVisXL_V4.0_Lightning model for quality and black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev for text generation within the image

ME: Too many steps actually makes text WORSE with the flux model.  Too few is also bad.  There's a goldilocks zone.  20 seems to be about right.  100 was definitely too much.
