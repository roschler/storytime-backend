IMAGE GENERATION TIPS FROM OTHERS:

TIP 1: With flux dev i've noticed lower steps makes the images much flatter but higher steps are needed for images where the main focus is text, like a logo

TIP 2: I really like the SG161222/RealVisXL_V4.0_Lightning model for quality and black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev for text generation within the image

ME: Too many steps actually makes text WORSE with the flux model.  Too few is also bad.  There's a goldilocks zone.  20 seems to be about right.  100 was definitely too much.
