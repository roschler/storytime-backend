// Todo list and general notes.

REMEMBER!: tsconfig.json has sections that control the approved image download URLs!  We will need to add our AWS S3 bucket to this list.

- NEXT: Where and when do we actually make an image request?  The Chatbot
 app flow is more complicated than the Storytime app.  Call handleImageRequest()
 once that is determined.

- Lower stable diffusion steps during BRAINSTORM mode and higher in REFINE mode.
- Add the general negative prompts from storytime repo
- Use sharp NPM package to optimize images before returning them to the client
- Copy the optimized images to our S3 bucket
- Use S3 bucket URLs for NFT asset URLs.
- Create Amazon S3 bucket for generated images for the contest.  Later we can use a decentralized solution.
